# bilrost-derive

`bilrost-derive` is part of the [`bilrost`][b] library. It handles generating
encoding and decoding implementations for Rust types with `bilrost` annotations.
For the most part, users of `bilrost` shouldn't need to interact with
`bilrost-derive` directly, and should instead use the re-exports.
