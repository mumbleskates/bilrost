/// A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented
/// as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond
/// resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day"
/// or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between
/// two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted
/// from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.
///
/// Values of this type are not guaranteed to only exist in their normalized
/// form.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.
///
/// ```text
/// Timestamp start = ...;
/// Timestamp end = ...;
/// Duration duration = ...;
///
/// duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds;
/// duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;
///
/// if (duration.seconds < 0 && duration.nanos > 0) {
///    duration.seconds += 1;
///    duration.nanos -= 1000000000;
/// } else if (duration.seconds > 0 && duration.nanos < 0) {
///    duration.seconds -= 1;
///    duration.nanos += 1000000000;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.
///
/// ```text
/// Timestamp start = ...;
/// Duration duration = ...;
/// Timestamp end = ...;
///
/// end.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds;
/// end.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;
///
/// if (end.nanos < 0) {
///    end.seconds -= 1;
///    end.nanos += 1000000000;
/// } else if (end.nanos >= 1000000000) {
///    end.seconds += 1;
///    end.nanos -= 1000000000;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Example 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.
///
/// ```text
/// td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10)
/// duration = Duration()
/// duration.FromTimedelta(td)
/// ```

/// # JSON Mapping
///
/// In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the

/// {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional
/// seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution),
/// are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone
/// is required. A proto3 JSON serializer should always use UTC (as indicated by
/// "Z") when printing the Timestamp type and a proto3 JSON parser should be
/// able to accept both UTC and other timezones (as indicated by an offset).
///
/// For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past
