## v0.1000.0

This is the first rough release of `bilrost`. It is largely tested and feature
complete.

Some breaking refactors to the *internal* apis (those exposed within the
`encoding` module, still hidden from the docs for now) may appear in subsequent
versions, but the plan is that anything that works correctly and is exposed
directly in the root `bilrost` module should continue to work the same,
including everything in user-facing traits and re-exported derive macros.

Significant work in expanding the documentation and readme remains, and fuzzing
still needs to be reenabled.
